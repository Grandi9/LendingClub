# LendingClub

## Introduction

Lending Club is an online lending platform that follows the Peer-to-Peer(P2P) lending business
Model. This model enables borrowers and lenders to engage in online borrowing and lending
processes dodging the traditional loan process. One of the biggest advantages of the P2P platform
is that the loans are offered at a much lesser interest rate than the loans offered by conventional
banks. (https://www.lendingclub.com/)
